## Description of my website

I made a colourful, resposive and simple resume with 4 sections each focusing on a different aspect of the resume. This website would be useful to show to potectial employers as a way to show my personality and quality of work. The list of sections is:
- Home:
  includes my name and an image
- My Work
  Has my work aspirations and clearly outlines my name and welcomes the user.
- Education
  includes my educaiton and nifty bars that show my confidence in different skills
- Contact Me
  My details and a form to allow the user to directly message me.
